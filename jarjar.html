In Honor of today's release of <u>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</u>, we will be reviewing one of the most popular fan theories relating to the upcomng movie, and it invovles Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar Binks made his first appearance in the first Prequel Movie. He was not looked upon kindly by Star Wars fans as he was seen as a useless character included for just Comic Relief. Before we give you the evidence we first must explain the Darth Plageuis theory.
Darth Plagueis is a character not shown in any of the films but was mentioned in Episode III by Emperor Palpatine. Palpatine states that he was the most powerful sith lord who could
save others from death but could not save himself when his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It was assumed that Palpatine himself was the apprentice. The fan theory states that Plagueis was actually able to save himself butinstead of seeking revenge, he retreated into the shadows and let Palpatine build the empire, forseeing its fall. And now. in Episode VII, he has returned as Grandmaster Snoke, the leadr of the Knights of Ren.
Below is a video further explaining it.

<br/><br/>
 Now Another fan theory states that Darth Plagueis is actually Jar Jar Binks. They cite evidence such as his ability to perform acrobatics usually only done by a Jedi. ar Jar could also be seen
 using mind control on characters such as Padme and the Gungan king. Jar Jar was also the one who convinced the senate to put Palpatine in power as supreme chancellor.
 In Episode I, Jar Jar's return to his hometown struck fear into the other citizen who said he was banned, suggesting he did some bad things in his past. It was also quoted by George Lucas that he made some drastic changes to the prequels after fan backlash, including removing a big supprise. Since Jar Jar was so hated by fans, it was his role that was possibly diminished and he was not revealed to be Darth Plageuis. 
 Now, it is possible that he could be revealed to be Darth Plageuis either in Episode VII, or the two that will follow, even though George Lucas was not involved in the film-making process.
 Below is a video further explaining the evidence that Jar Jar is Darth Plageuis.
